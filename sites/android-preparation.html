    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA. A sticky left-hand navigation menu allows for quick jumps to any topic. The main content area begins with a bar chart visualizing topic frequency for a high-level overview. This is followed by detailed, expandable content cards for each topic. This structure was chosen to allow both a quick, data-driven assessment of priorities and deep, self-paced exploration of content, which is more effective for studying than a simple linear document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Topic Frequency Ratings (★★★) -> Goal: Compare priorities -> Viz: Chart.js Horizontal Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Provides an immediate, clear visual hierarchy of topic importance.
        - Report Info: Conceptual Explanations (e.g., Lifecycles, Architecture) -> Goal: Inform & Explain -> Method: Styled HTML cards with Tailwind CSS -> Interaction: Clickable navigation links -> Justification: Breaks down complex information into manageable, themed sections.
        - Report Info: Comparative Topics (e.g., MVP vs MVVM) -> Goal: Compare -> Method: HTML tables within cards -> Interaction: N/A -> Justification: Tables provide a clear, side-by-side format for easy comparison.
        - Report Info: Hierarchical Structures (OS Stack) -> Goal: Organize -> Method: Stacked divs with Tailwind -> Interaction: N/A -> Justification: Creates a clear visual hierarchy without using forbidden SVG/Mermaid.

                <p class="mb-4">A Fragment is an actor within the Activity's play. Its lifecycle is more complex, tied to both its own state and the host Activity. The most critical methods to understand are <strong>onAttach()</strong>, <strong>onCreateView()</strong>, and <strong>onDestroyView()</strong>, as this is where the UI is created and destroyed, a common source of memory leaks if not handled properly.</p>

                    <li><strong>Explicit Intent:</strong> A letter with a specific address. You know exactly which component to start (e.g., navigating to another Activity within your own app).</li>
                    <li><strong>Implicit Intent:</strong> A public announcement. You declare an action (e.g., "share this photo"), and the system finds an app that can handle it.</li>
                    <li><strong>PendingIntent:</strong> A pre-signed check. You give another app (like the Notification Manager) permission to execute your Intent at a later time with your app's permissions.</li>

                    <li><strong>FrameLayout:</strong> A stack of papers. Each new view is placed on top of the last. Good for overlays.</li>
                    <li><strong>ConstraintLayout:</strong> The modern standard. Uses flexible "elastic bands" (constraints) to position elements. It's powerful and performant because it allows for flat view hierarchies.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">RecyclerView: The Efficient Restaurant</h4>
                <p class="mb-2">The modern way to display long, scrollable lists. Its efficiency comes from recycling views. Instead of creating a new view for every item in the list, it reuses the views that scroll off-screen.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>ViewHolder:</strong> The reusable table setting. Holds the views for a single item. This pattern is enforced in RecyclerView to guarantee performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adapter:</strong> The head waiter. Connects the data to the RecyclerView, creating new ViewHolders as needed and binding data to them as the user scrolls.</li>

                <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2">Material Design</h4>
                <p>Google's design system. Key principles include using "digital paper and ink" to create a sense of depth and hierarchy, using motion to provide meaning, and having a bold, intentional visual style. Modern apps use Material Components and support features like Dark Mode.</p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Foreground Service:</strong> A service the user is actively aware of, indicated by a persistent notification (e.g., a music player or navigation app). These have a higher priority and are less likely to be killed by the system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Background Service:</strong> A service performing work the user isn't directly aware of. Since Android 8 (Oreo), these are heavily restricted and often cannot run for more than a few minutes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Modern Background Task Scheduling</h4>
                <p class="mb-2">For most background tasks, especially those that need to run reliably even if the app closes, you should not use a Service directly. The modern, recommended solution is <strong>WorkManager</strong>.</p>
                <h5 class="font-semibold mt-2">WorkManager: The Smart Chore Manager</h5>
                <p>WorkManager is the best tool for deferrable, guaranteed background work. You can define work with constraints (e.g., "only run on Wi-Fi," "only run when charging"), and WorkManager will ensure it executes under the right conditions, even if the app is closed or the device restarts. It's battery-efficient and handles OS-level restrictions for you.</p>

                <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">The Main Thread: A Single-Lane Drive-Thru</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The main (UI) thread handles all user input and screen drawing. If you perform a long task on it (like a complex order), the entire UI freezes. If it's frozen for too long (~5 seconds), the system shows an "Application Not Responding" (ANR) error. All long tasks must be moved to a background thread.</p>
                <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Kotlin Coroutines: The Modern Solution</h4>
                <p class="mb-2">Coroutines are the recommended way to manage background tasks in modern Android development. They are lightweight, efficient, and safer than older solutions like AsyncTask.</p>
                <h5 class="font-semibold mt-2">Structured Concurrency: A Head Chef and Kitchen Staff</h5>
                <p class="mb-4">This is the key safety feature of coroutines. Every coroutine runs in a scope (the head chef). If the scope is cancelled (e.g., the user leaves the screen), all the work within it (the cooks) is automatically cancelled too. This prevents memory leaks and wasted resources.</p>
                <h5 class="font-semibold mt-2">Kotlin Flow: A Factory Conveyor Belt</h5>
                <p>Flow is a coroutine-based tool for handling streams of asynchronous data. It's like a conveyor belt that produces items (emits data), which can be modified along the way (intermediate operators like 'map' or 'filter') before being collected by a worker at the end (the 'collect' terminal operator).</p>

                <p class="mb-4"><strong>Retrofit</strong> is the industry-standard library for making type-safe network calls in Android.

                <p class="mb-4"><strong>Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)</strong> is the architecture pattern recommended by Google. It separates the UI (View) from the business logic and data (Model) using a ViewModel.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The View (a tablet) places an order. The ViewModel (the system managing the order queue) updates its state. The View observes the ViewModel and automatically updates itself when the order status changes. The ViewModel doesn't know about the View, making it highly testable and reusable.</p>

                <p class="mb-2">Dependency Injection is a pattern where an object's dependencies (other objects it needs) are provided to it, rather than created by it. This promotes loose coupling and testability.</p>
