    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive toolkit with a tabbed/navigated interface for four main sections: 'Company Deep Dive', 'Aptitude Arsenal', 'Specialized Skills', and 'Study Plan'. This task-oriented structure was chosen over a linear report layout because students preparing for placements need to quickly access specific information (e.g., a single company's pattern or a specific topic's tricks) rather than reading sequentially. This design facilitates targeted learning and quick reference, improving usability. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Company Patterns (Goal: Compare): Presented via interactive buttons that dynamically update a content area and a Chart.js donut chart showing time distribution per section. This provides focused, at-a-glance comparison. 2. Aptitude Tricks (Goal: Organize/Inform): A nested accordion using HTML/JS to break down dense information by skill and topic, preventing overload. 3. Study Plan (Goal: Organize): A simple accordion to present the 4-week plan in a digestible, step-by-step format. All diagrams and icons are built with HTML/CSS/Unicode to avoid SVG/images. Library: Chart.js (Canvas). -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
